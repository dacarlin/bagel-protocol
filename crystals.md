# Procedures

### Transformation

Transform plasmids into *Escherichia coli* BLR(DE3) cells (chemical or electrocompetent), recover, and plate on 50 µg/mL kanamycin selection plates. Pick single colonies from fresh plates (< 24 hours after transformation) for growth.

- *Escherichia coli*
- lag phase
- log phase
- senesence

### Media prep

Make two flasks per mutant. In each flask, make media. Use 500 mL Terrific Broth supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin from 1000X stock. Autoclave and allow to cool before using. Media should be clear and not smell burnt.

### Culture

1. Pre-warm media in flasks to 37 ˚C by putting flasks in shaker 30 minutes before inoculating.
2. Inoculate flasks with single colonies from fresh (<24 hours after transformation) plate.

### Growth

3. Grow at 37 ˚C for 16-24 hours with shaking at 300 RPM.

### Induction

Make induction media in the reserved flasks supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 1 mM IPTG from 1000X stocks, and label the flasks.

In clean, autoclaved centrifuge buckets, pellet cells, and resuspend in about 10 mL reserved media  **from the labeled flask you are going to use**. Add the resuspended cells into the flask.  

Grow at 18 ˚C for 16-24 hours with shaking at 300 RPM.

Pellet cells and resuspend in ~ 10 mL equilibration buffer.

### Lysis

Add equilibration buffer to 40 mL and sonicate. Program

- 30 seconds on
- 60 seconds off
- 30 seconds on
- 60 seconds off
- 30 seconds on
- 60 seconds off

Keep on ice at all times so that the temperature of the lysing mix doesn't get past room temperature.

Centrifuge the lysate for 1-2 hours at 4,700 RPM at 4˚C.  

### Purification

Add 500 µL of Ni-NTA resin slurry to large protein purification columns. Pour in ~ 10 mL equilibration buffer
