## Introduction

The prediction of function for the billions of proteins for which we have sequence information but no structural or mechanistic information is a staggering problem, even compared to the related problem of determining a protein's overall fold from primary sequence alone. Even for protein superfamilies such as the family 1 glycoside hydrolases which have representatives in the central metabolism of nearly every organism on Earth [] and have been characterized both structrally [] and mechanistically [], predictions of functional sequences by molecular modeling tools such as Rosetta is not possible.

As part of an ongoing effort to build data sets for the improvement of molecular modeling using Rosetta, we present kinetic constants kcat, KM, and kcat/KM and protein melting temperature (Tm) for 15 mutants of a family 1 glycoside hydrolase for which a large data set is being constructed [].

Studies such as this one not only uncover sequence-function and sequence-stability relationships in this important class of enzymes, but also contribute to machine learning data sets that are being used to improve molecular models of protein function for their use in medical research [], engineering [], and food production [].

## Materials and methods

__Bacterial growth, protein production, purification, determination of yield and purity__. As described previously [], *Escherichia coli* BLR were transformed with sequence-verified pET29b plasmid containing the mutant sequence, grown at 37 ˚C with shaking at 300 RPM for 24 hours, pelleted, resuspended in fresh growth media containing 1 mM IPTG, and incubated at 18˚C with shaking at 300 RPM for 24 hours. His-tagged proteins were purified by IMAC (Ni-NTA) in 50 mM HEPES buffer with 150 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole (wash) or 25 mM EDTA (assay). Total protein yield was assessed by ultraviolet spectroscopy and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE.

__Enzyme assay, data analysis__. Kinetic parameters kcat, KM, and kcat/KM and protein melting temperatrue were determined by visible spectroscopy of pNPG hydrolysis carried out in 96-well plates, as described previously []. To determine Michaelis-Menten parameters, ... . To determine protein melting temperature, ... . Assay data were ... .

## Results

A total of 15 mutants of BglB were produced and purified in this study, along with the native sequence as a control. A table of kcat, KM, kcat/KM, ... for each mutant can be found in Table 1.
