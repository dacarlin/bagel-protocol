# Recipes

This is deep prep: making the stock solutions that you will use throughout the procedures in this repository. For where to source parts, check out the [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106pUlbfcXcYa9Vg8fXZFAt3Imil9BYLZ1ztZ-R9lcZw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Advice:** Approach deep prep with the patience of a Zen master.

## LB plates with kanamycin (25 plates)

Autoclave 250 mL water with 2 pellets of LB agar in a 500 mL bottle. After autoclaving, hold in 50 C dry bath until 50 C, then add 250 μL 1000X kanamycin solution. Use a serological pipet to pour plates.

Two-day style: autoclave, allow to solidify and store at room temperature. To use, microwave for 5 min, hold in 50 C dry bath till 50 C, add kanamycin, and pour.

## Lysis mix (100 reactions)

Combine 80 mg lysozyme, 10 mg DNAse, and 10 mg PMSF in a Falcon tube and shake well to combine. Store at -20 C.

## Terrific broth (TB) (250 mL)

Dissolve 12.5 g dry Terrific Broth in 250 mL water in a 500 mL bottle and autoclave.

## 1 M isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1000X IPTG) (1 mL)

Dissolve 240 mg IPTG in 1 mL wash buffer. Store 100 μL aliquots at –20 C.

## Wash buffer (1 L)

Dissolve 11.9 g HEPES, 8.7 g sodium chloride, and 0.68 g imidazole in water and adjust pH to 7.50 using sodium hydroxide.

## Protein buffer (1 L)

Dissolve 11.9 g HEPES, 8.7 g sodium chloride, and 7.31 g EDTA in water and adjust pH to 7.50 using sodium hydroxide.

## 0.1 M 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (substrate) (33 mL)

Dissolve 1 g 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside in 33 mL protein buffer and store 1 mL aliquots at -20 C. Easiest way to get it to dissolve is to make in 50 mL Falcon tube and vortex for 5-10 minutes.

## 50 mg/mL kanamycin (1000X kanamycin) (10 mL)

Dissolve 500 mg kanamycin in 10 mL water and store 250 uL aliquots at -20 C.
