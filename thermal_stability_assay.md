# Assay to determine thermal stability of β-glucosidase B mutants

This procedure assumes that you followed the protein production and
purification procedure in this repo

## Materials

Material | Concentration | Amount per sample
---------|---------------|------------------
Purified protein | about 1 mg/mL | 140 µL
2 mL tube | | 1
substrate stock | 0.1 M | 800 µL per plate
15 mL Falcon tube | | 1
assay plate | | 1
PCR plate | | 1
clear plate seal | | 1

## Mise en place

+ repeater pipet and
+ P300 multichannel pipet and tips
+ Thermocycler
+ Plate reader

## Method

1. For each mutant, mix 140 µL of the purified protein and 1260 µL of protein buffer in a 2 mL tube
4. Aliquot 50 µL of diluted protein solution into PCR plate. Use three columns per mutant.
5. Incubate PCR plate for 30 min in the thermal cycler with a gradient from 30 C to 50 C (saved program BGLGRAD)
6. While that's running, mix 800 µL of substrate solution and 7.2 mL of protein buffer in a 15 mL Falcon tube
3. Use a repeater or multichannel pipet to transfer 75 µL of diluted substrate into all 96 wells of the assay plate
6. Using a multichannel, transfer 25 µL of each well of the PCR plate to the corresponding well in the assay plate
7. Monitor absorbance at 420 nm for 60 min using the plate reader
8. Add the data to the data reporting sheet
