# Thermostability assay: β-glucosidase B

This procedure assumes that you followed the protein production and
purification procedure in this folder.  

## Materials

Material | Concentration | Amount per sample
---------|---------------|------------------
Purified protein | about 1 mg/mL | 140 µL
2 mL tube | | 1 
pNPG solution | 0.1 M | 800 µL per plate 
15 mL Falcon tube | | 1 
assay plate | | 1 
PCR plate | | 1 
clear plate seal | | 1 

+ Repeater pipet 
+ Multichannel pipet
+ Thermocycler 
+ Plate reader 

## Method

1. For each mutant, mix 140 µL of the purified protein and 1260 µL of protein buffer in a 2 mL tube
4. Aliquot 50 µL of diluted protein solution into PCR plate. Use three columns per mutant. 
5. Theromocycle the PCR plate for 30 min with a gradient from 30 C to 50 C (saved program BGLGRAD) 
6. While that's running, mix 800 µL of substrate solution and 7.2 mL of protein buffer in a 15 mL Falcon tube
3. Use a repeater or multichannel pipet to transfer 75 µL of diluted substrate into all 96 wells of the assay plate
6. Using a multichannel, transfer 25 µL of each well of the PCR plate to the corresponding well in the assay plate
7. Monitor absorbance at 420 nm for 60 min using the plate reader
8. Add the data to the data reporting sheet
