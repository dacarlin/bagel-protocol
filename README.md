# Laboratory protocols for production and assay of β-glucosidase B 

The characterization of point mutants of β-glucosidase B from *P. polymxa* ("Bagel") is an ongoing project in the Siegel group. This repository contains all the laboratory protocols for the production and assay of mutants of this enzyme. 

+ In our group, we use an automated Kunkel mutagenesis procedure that runs on [Transcriptic's workcell](https://www.transcriptic.com/). Single-stranded DNA for this protocol is available for free from our lab, please email us. If you would like to perform this procedure by hand, you can follow [the Siegel group protocol for a manual Kunkel mutagenesis procedure](https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/folderview?usp=sharing&id=0B3zIXvOOrmpqcEM5WWRadThsVUE). 

The following protocols are used in our lab: 

+ `production.md` contains the instructions for production of protein beginning from purified plasmid 
+ `kinetics.md` contains instructions for determining Michaelis-Menten parameters from a convenient plate assay 
+ `thermostability.md` contains instructions for an assay to determine an enzyme's thermal denaturation temperature
+ `recipes.md` contains recipes for stock solutions used in the above three protocols 

These recipes are robust enough to allow those new to enzyme engineering (and indeed, those new to lab work) to produce high-quality, consistent results. Along with [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter/) for determining Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data, this repository provides a basis for any lab to get started with enzyme design.
