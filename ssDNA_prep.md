# Single-stranded DNA prep for Bagel project 

## Day 0: Production of ssDNA

### Materials 

+ chem competent CJ236 cells 
+ WT BglB plasmid 
+ selection plate containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol 
+ 15 mL round-bottom Falcon tube 

### Mise en place 

+ P1000 and tips 
+ plate
+ plasmid 
+ tube 
+ waste bukkette 

### Instructions

1. Transform plasmid into chemically competent CJ236 cells (initial stock is free from NEB, make your own from there.  Any standard chem comp method will work).
  * Plate onto a Chlor+YOUR ANTIBIOTIC plate and incubate overnight at 37.0 deg C.


## Day 1: ssDNA Production (growth, virus inoculation, and overnight) 

Materials | Concentration | Amount/ reaction
--------- | ------------- | ----------------
LB + YOUR antibiotic  |     n/a       |       3 mL
M13K07    |     n/a       |       3uL


### Mise en place 

+ waste bucket
+ P1000 and tips, P20 and tips
+ sirological pipet aspirator
+ 50mL sirological pipet
+ 250mL Erlenmeyer Flask

### Instructions
1. Inoculate 6 colonies into 3ml of LB + YOUR antibiotic. (NO chlor here per NEB instructions)
2. Grow for 4-6 hours at 370C, shaking at 200rpm (until cloudy=turbid).
3. Add 3ul of M13K07 helper phage.
4. Continue growing for 1 hour at 370C, shaking at 200rpm.
5. Expand culture by diluting 1ml into 50ml of LB + antibiotic in 250ml flask.
6. Grow overnight at 370C, shaking at 200rpm.


## Day 2: Harvesting ssDNA 

Materials | Concentration | Amount/ reaction
--------- | ------------- | ----------------
20% PEG   |     2.5 M      |       10 ml
1xPBS      |     n/a       |       2 ml (1st resuspension)
1xPBS     |     n/a       |       1 ml (2nd resuspension)
PEG/NaCl  |   n/a         |       2 ml
PNK Buffer  |     n/a     |       3 ul
ATP       |     10mM      |       1 ul
T4 Polynucleotide Kinase  |       n/a     |     1 ul
ddiH2O    |     n/a       |       18 ul


### Mise en place 

+ 50 ml Falcon tubes (x2)
+ Microfuge tubes
+ Pipette
+ PCR strip tubes or 96well PCR Plate

### Instructions

*Minirecipe:* KRM (n+2) = 3ul PNK Buffer + 1ul ATP + 1ul T4 Polynucleotide Kinase + 18ul ddih2O

1. Spin down overnight culture in sterile 50ml Falcon tube at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 40C.
2. Transfer supernatant (contains phage) to a new sterile 50ml Falcon tube. 
3. Add 10ml 20% PEG/2.5M NaCl and mix thoroughly and incubate on ice for 45 minutes.
4. Spin down the phage at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 40C.
5. Decant liquid and let tube stand upright to drain off the rest of the liquid. 
6. Resuspend the pellet in 2ml 1xPBS. Vortexing is okay.
7. Spin at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
8. Transfer the supernatant to new microfuge tubes with 300ul PEG/NaCl.
9. Vortex and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. 
10. Spin down phage at 14,000rpm for 2 minutes. 
11. Pipette off supernatant. Do a second quick spin to collect residual liquid and pipette it off.
12. Resuspend the pellet (phage) in 1ml 1xPBS.
13. Spin down at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes.
14. Transfer the supernatant (phage) to a new microfuge tube.
15. Harvesting ssDNA from Phage using Qiagen Qiaprep M13 kit (#27704)
    * DO NOT SPIN OVER 8000rpm when using this kit!
    * Final solution should be greater than 20ng/uL.  If not try again; ssDNA can randomly fail so often it is best to make 2 batches in parallel (works as a nice counter balance as well).
